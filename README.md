Take YouTube TimeStamped Notes and sync them to Obsidian

## Why
I don't like the flow of The Obsidian Media Extended. Where you have to open the video in the obsidian. When click at the timestamp, it will open the video in the browser instead of the obsidian app. This is kind of annoying.

The taking note flow within the browser should be better. I want to take notes in the browser, and sync them to the obsidian. With the browser extension, we have a total control of youtube and the note taking flow.

## What
Imagine [Transnote](https://www.transnote.co/#features) + [Obsidian Web](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/obsidian-web/edoacekkjanmingkbkgjndndibhkegad)[gh](https://github.com/coddingtonbear/obsidian-web) + [Obsidian Local REST API](https://github.com/coddingtonbear/obsidian-local-rest-api)
